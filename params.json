The dataset has almost half a million diamonds, all with GIA certification. I found an interesting anomaly with carat size that might indicate fraud (it's the first graph of the three polished graphs at the end).\r\n\r\n[Knitted html version of the project](Diamonds.html)  \r\n[Rmd file for the project](Diamonds.Rmd)\r\n\r\n![windsurfer](500by100pics/windsurfer.png)\r\n\r\n### Exploration of the Lahman Baseball dataset\r\nI used pandas and a number of the Python graphing packages to explore some relationships in the Lahman Baseball dataset.\r\n\r\n[An html version of the project](../Udacity-Project2/Project\\ 2.html)  \r\n\r\n![mountains](500by100pics/mountains1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
